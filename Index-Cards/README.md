### Project Test Link: [Index Cards App](https://larrytimmins.github.com/Index-Cards/)
Modified above link to test use of Kubernetes related questions added to JS/dataService.js

Please see https://jcsmileyjr.github.io/Index-Cards/   for original Author Purpose, Motivation, Objectives

### Purpose:
Drill questions on Kubernetes as I am exposed to Kubernetes related information.  Starting with basics on Kubernetes cluster components (kube01 was first update to JS/dataService.js).   Will keep initial version in spirit with Online vocabulary test based on subjects - just now it will be Kubernetes focused instead of physical sciences. 

My current goal is to see if I need to add array of choices when more than one correct answer 
exists (i.e., Docker, rkt and "container orchestration enginer" all are correct answers to the question "What runs the configured pods in Kubernetes?".  Right now, like the original, the test is split into two types, multiple choice and a matching. 

### Motivation:
I like the solution found by JCSmileyJR and wants to see if I could borrow it so I could focus on content, and quickly get to several hundred questions.   Once I find it works -- I will explore how to ask questions that can show 3 to 4 different series of lab command sequences and have the person answer 2-3 sub questions for each 'lab'.

I fully support the author's motication "I determine the solution is an online version of this simple but effective learning strategy. The greatest advantage is the use of her cell phone to study anywhere/anytime and none of the physical version disadvantages." 

### Objectives: (original author's objectives for now)
* The online test will allow multiple choice but have an option for a harder matching version.
* The online test would show a constant grade for feedback.
* The online test should show the correct answer if the student chooses incorrectly.
* Bonus if the test can be reuse weeks later to study for final exams.

### Example of Use:
1.	Click on a test, either Multi-Choice or Fill in the Blank
2.	Read the question and choose an answer either from the radio buttons or select button. 

3.	Press the “Finish” button to confirm if the answer is correct.
4.	Press reviewing the results, press the “Done” button to continue to the next question. 
5.	When all questions is completed a final score is shown and user is taken back to the landing page.

### Features:
* Hot streak: Celebration of student answering multiple questions correctly
* Beat your Top Score: Display the highest score the student achevied for that test
* 2 types of tests: Multiple Choice and Fill in the Blank
* Display current score
* Show correct answers to all questions
